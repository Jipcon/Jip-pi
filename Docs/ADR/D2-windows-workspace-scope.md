# D2 — Windows Workspace Scope

- Status: **Accepted**
- Source: original `DESIGN.md` decision table

## Context

This decision is extracted from the original main design document to avoid duplicating the same conclusion across architecture sections, invariants, implementation status, and test matrices.

## Decision

The initial version only supports Git worktree; non-Git workspaces explicitly return `UnsupportedWorkspace`.

## Scope

This ADR does not add new semantics beyond what was frozen in the original text. `Accepted` means the original text confirmed it; `Proposed` means the original text explicitly listed it as a recommended default for later confirmation.
